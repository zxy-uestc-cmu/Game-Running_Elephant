<Git committing information>
In this sprint, because we have 4 people and work in pairs, so we mainly use the tool of "live share" plugin in vscode to collabrate together. Thus, the git committing information is not enough, please understand :)


<Git comit and branch>
At the half stage of this homework, I commit and push to the master branch. And I used 'sprint2' branch for the next half stage.
**** So please check my "git commit" information both in master branch and sprint2 branch !!!~~~ ****
